## About this project

SPIN is a distributed storage and compute framework. It aims to be one of the first peer-to-peer public cloud providers. Unlike commercial public clouds, SPIN is completely decentralized. It is supported by its own stake-holders on their own hardware, rather than in federated datacenters. SPIN stakeholders donate, or sell small quantities of their compute resources in return for stake in the network.
